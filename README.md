# Python Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- statsmodel
- scikit-learn

## Objective

Our goal is to find the predictors for survivability during the Titanic tragedy using machine learning.


## About the dataset

The dataset records attributes from 888 passengers. It features:

- Passenger ID
- Survived
- Passenger class
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- Siblings aboard
- Parents aboard

The dataset can be found on the Stanford University [website](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/problem12.html).

# I/Defining the goal:

The Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in 1912. Carrying more than 2 200 passengers on board, the boat never made it to its final destination, New York City.
This event had a massive impact on our modern culture. The infamous James Cameron movie always made me wonder about the nature of the profiles who survived.<br>
Who were they?

Today, we will answer this question by analyzing the given data.

What made the Titanic survivor so special? 

Using diverse machine learning techniques, this project will aim at defining the best and worst predictors of survival according to the dataset. 

# II/Data Wrangling: 

After importing libraries and setting the directory.<br>
Our first task is to look for missing values.

Since the data has a binary outcome, we will use logistic regression.
In order to prepare our data for the regression we need to convert some string value into numerical.

# III/ Analysis:

To get an idea of how the data is structured, we will plot some of its features.

Let's first take a look at the age range of the passengers.

As we can see, most of the individuals were between 15 and 35 years old.
