# Python Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- statsmodel
- scikit-learn

## Objective

Our goal is to find the predictors for survivability during the Titanic tragedy using machine learning.


## About the dataset

The dataset records attributes from 888 passengers. It features:

- Passenger ID
- Survived
- Passenger class
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- Siblings aboard
- Parents aboard

The dataset can be found on the Stanford University [website](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/problem12.html).

# I/Defining the goal:

By training several models on the given data. Our goal is to find the best and worst predictors for survival. 

# II/Data Wrangling: 



# III/ Analysis:


# Conclusion
